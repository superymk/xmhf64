/// @file Support PCI 16550 serial cards
/// Only tested with PIO accesses only.
///
/// How to use:
/// (1) One should find the PIO base of the PCI-serial card first with "lspci -vvv"
/// (2) Modify the <baseaddr> in <cb_serial> with that PIO base
///
/// Note: One should be careful with multi-ports PCI-serial card, because the code initialize the first logical port only.

/// dbg-x86-uart.c is limited in supporting PCI-serial cards. For example, it does not support cards using MMIO only.
